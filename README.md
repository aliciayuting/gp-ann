Experimental research code for our paper "Unleashing Graph Partitioning for Large-Scale Nearest Neighbor Search".

The ```exp_scripts``` folder contains scripts to download the datasets (beware they are large and downloading MS Turing takes forever) and build the source code -- in a way that is expected by the experiment scripts, e.g., ```experiments.py```.
